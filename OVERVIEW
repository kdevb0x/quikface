QuikFace is a functionality clone of facetime. Which means it is ment to do the
same thing as facetime, however it does it in a different way, and cross platform.
(At least, thats the goal ;P )

The high level overview looks like this:
(MAY CHANGE AT ANY POINT)

A client (INITCLIENT) binds a listener to a random open port, then dials out to the HTTP server
with it's ip, the port it is listening on, and a telephone number of who they wish
to contact, who we'll call CONTACTCLIENT. (This may change in the future)

The HTTP server dials back to the clients ip and listening port, and maintains a
heartbeat connection until the requested number is contacted somehow (YTBD)
at which point the CONTACTCLIENT does like INITCLIENT and binds a listener to
a random open port and reaches out to the HTTP server with its ip, and listening
port. The HTTP server then initiates the connection between INITCLIENT and
CONTACTCLIENT and ties thier respective video and audio streams together.

At this point I am not sure if the HTTP server will maintain any state
about the connected session (like total time, if a side drops, etc)
but it might in order to make sure the connection is cleaned up,
or reconnect an interupted session etc.
