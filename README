Vidchat is a simple program to make cross platform video chat possible.

This need was realized after attempting to initiate a video chat session between an iphone and an android device. Android doesnt support facetime, as well as the istore doesn't offer google's Duo, or other similar free, and new-user friendly vchat applications.
